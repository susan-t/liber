## Project Overview
An application where users can borrow and loan out physical books to the community. Users can add their own books to the shared catalog, browse the collection, and request to borrow books posted by other users. Once a request has been made, the owner can quickly approve or decline the loan. If approved, the owner will drop off the book at an approved location for a convenient pick-up time frame. If declined, the loanee will be notified with reason. A built-in rating system allows loaners and borrows to ensure trustworthy exchanges and high quality book handling.
